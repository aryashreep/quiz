                        Although Lord Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, out of His causeless mercy He was
                        engaged in the service of His friend. He never fails in His affection for His devotees, and thus
                        He is addressed herein as infallible. As charioteer, He had to carry out the orders of Arjuna,
                        and since He did not hesitate to do so, He is addressed as infallible. Although He had accepted
                        the position of a charioteer for His devotee, His supreme position was not challenged. In all
                        circumstances, He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hṛṣīkeśa, the Lord of the total senses.
                        The relationship between the Lord and His servitor is very sweet and transcendental. The
                        servitor is always ready to render service to the Lord, and, similarly, the Lord is always
                        seeking an opportunity to render some service to the devotee. He takes greater pleasure in His
                        pure devotee’s assuming the advantageous position of ordering Him than He does in being the
                        giver of orders. Since He is master, everyone is under His orders, and no one is above Him to
                        order Him. But when He finds that a pure devotee is ordering Him, He obtains transcendental
                        pleasure, although He is the infallible master in all circumstances.

                        As a pure devotee of the Lord, Arjuna had no desire to fight with his cousins and brothers, but
                        he was forced to come onto the battlefield by the obstinacy of Duryodhana, who was never
                        agreeable to any peaceful negotiation. Therefore, he was very anxious to see who the leading
                        persons present on the battlefield were. Although there was no question of a peacemaking
                        endeavor on the battlefield, he wanted to see them again, and to see how much they were bent
                        upon demanding an unwanted war.

                        Since every living entity is an individual soul, each is changing his body every moment,
                        manifesting sometimes as a child, sometimes as a youth and sometimes as an old man. Yet the same
                        spirit soul is there and does not undergo any change. This individual soul finally changes the
                        body at death and transmigrates to another body; and since it is sure to have another body in
                        the next birth – either material or spiritual – there was no cause for lamentation by Arjuna on
                        account of death, neither for Bhīṣma nor for Droṇa, for whom he was so much concerned. Rather,
                        he should rejoice for their changing bodies from old to new ones, thereby rejuvenating their
                        energy. Such changes of body account for varieties of enjoyment or suffering, according to one’s
                        work in life. So Bhīṣma and Droṇa, being noble souls, were surely going to have spiritual bodies
                        in the next life, or at least life in heavenly bodies for superior enjoyment of material
                        existence. So, in either case, there was no cause of lamentation.

                        There are many pseudo meditators who misrepresent themselves as belonging to high parentage, and
                        great professional men who falsely pose that they have sacrificed everything for the sake of
                        advancement in spiritual life. Lord Kṛṣṇa did not want Arjuna to become a pretender. Rather, the
                        Lord desired that Arjuna perform his prescribed duties as set forth for kṣatriyas. Arjuna was a
                        householder and a military general, and therefore it was better for him to remain as such and
                        perform his religious duties as prescribed for the householder kṣatriya. Such activities
                        gradually cleanse the heart of a mundane man and free him from material contamination. So-called
                        renunciation for the purpose of maintenance is never approved by the Lord, nor by any religious
                        scripture. After all, one has to maintain one’s body and soul together by some work. Work should
                        not be given up capriciously, without purification of materialistic propensities. Anyone who is
                        in the material world is certainly possessed of the impure propensity for lording it over
                        material nature, or, in other words, for sense gratification. Such polluted propensities have to
                        be cleared. Without doing so, through prescribed duties, one should never attempt to become a
                        so-called transcendentalist, renouncing work and living at the cost of others.
